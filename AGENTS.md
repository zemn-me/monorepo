# hello robot

This file is for robots... if you learn anything that would be important to remember next time, please commit it to this file!

# tools

this is a bazel monorepo. `bazel` is provided in `$PATH`. It maps to ./sh/bin/bazel. There are many tools in ./sh/bin that can be used and they are all added to $PATH.

A lot of your tools are run through bazel and therefore get confused by relative paths. Please use `$(pwd)/path/to/file` to get a relative path!

please run gazelle also! Or the presubmit will fail.

# rules_itest services

When adding background processes for integration tests, define them with `rules_itest` so ports are auto-assigned. Reference service ports via `ASSIGNED_PORTS` (e.g. struct fields tagged with `json:"@@//path:service"`), and avoid hard-coding addresses—`rules_itest` and `inject_iservice` handle plumbing.

# tests

don't forget to write tests!

Changes must be tested via bazel test path/to/your/changes/...

Bazel WILL take a long time! please don't interrupt the process! let it time out naturally...

If your tests take too long, you can use `bazel query` to pick a more specific set of tests!

- Avoid introducing or relying on custom `window.*` globals to communicate state to tests; prefer observing behaviour through the DOM, network responses, or existing APIs instead.


# generated files

do not commit generated files! those files should be generated by bazel!!

`//:base_defs` generates `.d.ts` types for CSS modules, so don't commit those.
