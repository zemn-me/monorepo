hello robot

this is a bazel monorepo. You must invoke bazel via ./sh/bin/bazel.

please run ./sh/bin/gazelle also! Or the presubmit will fail.

Changes must THEN be tested via ./sh/bin/bazel test path/to/your/changes/...

don't forget to write tests!

If you get stuck on a problem for a while and future agents could benefit from what you learned, write it down here so they do not run into the same issue.
