* Next bundles some deps without typings (`next/dist/compiled/*`, `VAR_MODULE_GLOBAL_ERROR`, `react-server-dom-webpack/server.edge`). The shim lives at `//ts/next.js/types/next-compiled` and is wired into Next-specific rules: `_next_srcset` (used by `next_project`) and the local `ts_project` in this package include it directly. Global `ts_project` does **not** auto-add the shim; if you depend on `//:node_modules/next` outside these rules, add `//ts/next.js/types/next-compiled` yourself. No global tsconfig paths are needed.
