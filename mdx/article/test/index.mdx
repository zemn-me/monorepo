### Lists with Paragraphs

1.  Growing up in the suburbs in post-war Japan, it seemed to Hajime that everyone but him had brothers and sisters. His sole companion was Shimamoto, also an only child. Together they spent long afternoons listening to her father's record collection.

But when his family moved away, the two lost touch. Now Hajime is in his thirties. After a decade of drifting he has found happiness with his loving wife and two daughters, and success running a jazz bar. Then Shimamoto reappears. She is beautiful, intense, enveloped in mystery. Hajime is catapulted into the past, putting at risk all he has in the present.

### Lists With Space

1.  This is a list item, which is really long, so I add a line at the end to make it more readable. MDX interprets that as a paragraph.

2.  This is a second item

## Blockquotes

> Both elbows on the table, I covered my face with my palms.
>
> Inside that darkness, I saw rain falling on the sea. Rain softly falling on a vast sea, with no one there to see it. The rain strikes the surface of the sea, yet even the fish don’t know it is raining.
>
> Until someone came and lightly rested a hand on my shoulder, my thoughts were of the sea.
> \-- Haruki Murakami, South of the Border, West of the Sun
