# The Impermanence of Death in Video Games

I remember video games when I was a kid, the ones that really got played a lot -- the ones that everyone talked about -- were different. I could talk forever about all the differences, but the one I want to talk about today is death.

Pokémon was fantastic, sure. But it was an experience for one person, and, in that time before social media and Twitch.tv an experience for one person was an experience had alone. Oh, it was wonderful, sure, but it was also isolating.

There were multiplayer games, of course. I played Age of Empires, and though I never played online I spent many hours building cities on the easiest mode, fighting only when I felt bored of it. Any increase in difficulty and I knew, intutively, really that the skirmishing wasn't for me. It wasn't fun to fight.

Then, one day I visited a friend's house and he was playing the original Counter Strike. I had never seen a game like this before. Being alive, and getting to shoot at people was so scary, and yet so much fun! But also, you'd only be alive a little, and then someone would inevitably shoot _you_, and then you'd be dead, and you'd have to wait so long for the timer to tick down, watching everyone else play. That wasn't fun at all.

I never played this game again, so I had a lot of time to think about it. It was so curious, I thought, how enjoyment is distributed. The players that do really well, and don't die must have a great time! Or -- do they? Maybe they're bored of it by that time. It's a zero-sum game. Or, maybe even less than that. Players who are winning take a bit of happiness from players who are losing, who, in order to balance the game spend some time out, having their loss rubbed in their faces. That's what I thought anyway. Maybe I was a bit sour about it.

Multiplayer games in the early 2000s were a lot like that, I feel. I can't say I played all of them, but I felt the same when I picked up Team Fortress 2 for the first time, and bumbled around only to be set on fire by some player who knew more than I did, and I bided my time waiting to respawn.

See, as an 'adult' now, I think a real trick to multiplayer games of this kind, of this time was the inevitability of the player's death -- and the player _had_ to die to keep the game fair. Every game toyed with solving this problem differently.

Team Fortress 2 ended up solving this a little bit by making _not fighting_ a fun option as much as fighting. That probably sounds odd to those who have played the game, but you can't deny how enjoyable it is to just _interact_ with players in Team Fortress; to sneak around through the sewers, attempt subterfuge as the Spy, or set up nests with the Engineer.

And, well, for Counter-Strike there were a few ways players made the game fun for themselves. There was the now famous 'gun game' player mod where players raced to kill the most of each other with increasingly good weapons (what we perhaps now might see as the League of Legends / Dota model) -- but it always eventually felt like chewing on sour candy.

Now, of course we know now that the _real_ draw of Counter-Strike is not playing against randoms, but playing in competitive modes where gameplay is long, deaths are significant (and therefore rare) and players are matched with similarly skilled players. This also solves the impermanence problem, in a way.

Then, years later comes _Call of Duty_. Well, for me, like most it was Modern Warfare 4. The game made respawn timers extremely low, so you could get right back into playing, and made it so you healed very fast if you accidentally got hit just a bit, then added _killstreaks_ that gave you incredible powers the more kills you got. It resulted in this frenetic, incredible gameplay that hooked players with little-to-no FPS experience, and little interest in competitive gameplay because -- well, the gameplay isn't very competitive.

Again, as we know now, the Call of Duty franchise, fun as it is can't really cash in on the esports money everyone else is because the skill ceiling is so low in a game like that. And watching a bunch of people play maybe 2 × better than you isn't all that fun. Oh, but I should say that I'm not saying CoD players are or were never skilled. Any circa 2010 YouTube kill compilation will tell you better -- but it's more that being able to click on heads really well can only get you so far when your enemies are back instantly and can shoot you with much less confounding automatic weapons.

I held this understanding so strongly that games couldn't be (1) competitive (2) consistently fun and (3) not lock you out of gameplay for, really an astoundingly long time considering how thoroughly that idea has been debunked by modern games.

The first time I saw streamers on Twitch.tv playing H1Z1, my first introduction to the 'Battle Royale' genre of games pioneered by Brendan Greene AKA PlayerUnknown, I knew that I'd been wrong, and, as soon as people worked out how to perfect the formula things were going to change very rapidly.

At this time, League of Legends was the biggest game in the world, by a huge margin. League is an incredibly well optimized game for fun. It's really competitive while not _forcing_ high technical difficulty on the player; it boasts a variety of incredibly distinct playstyles to suit different tastes; and it plays in this 'crescendo' of increasing player itemization that prevents the game becoming monotonous and keeps games down to a length that feels good to take short breaks between. But, in League of Legends you die. And dying feels bad.

See, in Battle Royale games, you still die, of course, but _not dying_ is just an aspirational goal more than anything. There's only one winner at the end of the day, and when you die, that's it, you're out of the game.

Oh if you pitched me that I'd think the premise was insane! I'd say "who is going to invest time into a game, only to be kicked out on their first death?". But there's real wisdom in it. If you're kicked out of the game, you can just start _another game_ immediately. No respawn timer! No zero-sum game! If that's optimized right, players can hit the ground running, on an even playing field, ready to _do-again_, all without having to watch all the other players having a great time without them.

That's smart, sure, but starting from the beginning has this surprising effect on gameplay that I'll explain using a totally unrelated metaphor. You probably know about diffusion, right? If you pump a gas into a room, it spreads out slowly over the room until it basically evenly covers the whole room. But gas isn't smart. It's got atoms, not brain cells, and it moves in this 'stochastic' way, where each little gas molecule just bounces around all the time like bees in a hive. So how does it know where it go?

Spontaneous order, my friend. Spontaneous order! Would you believe me that it's the same way that evolution makes such complex processes, or woodlice manage to find cold, damp places without knowing what cold or damp is?[^1] A gas molecule that's bunched up with a lot of other gas molecules has more gas to bounce into. Every time it hits another molecule, it bounces and goes off in some random direction.

[^1]: Woodlice, like many insects deploy a similar algorithm to find cold, safe places: if they feel warm, they move faster, and change direction more. If they feel cold, they move less. This way, they have a really good chance of being in a cool place, and will probably quickly get away from a warm place.

So think about it this way: the more bunched up a gas molecule is, the more likely it is to pick a direction that happens to be _away_ from all the other gas molecules, because it's bouncing more frequently against things. Gas that gets out into the open space is just going to keep going straight until it hits some more gas, and then it's going to, in all likelihood bounce _back_ into the open space. It's a naturally selective process!

Therein lies the neat thing about battle royale games. If you have a bad time in, say _Overwatch_, or _Counter-Strike_, or _Call of Duty_, you're stuck in that game lobby, getting beaten up by those players until you start your next game. There's a cointoss at the beginning of every game that decides if the game is going to be fun, and you're stuck with it for 20-40 minutes. These games _actively penalize_ you if you leave earlier. But if you're in battle royale, no biggie, you can just quit out. Even before you die, if you're getting bored of it.

In this way, players of battle royale games get supreme choice to actively spend time in the games they actually _enjoy_. At any time, they can just end it and re-roll another one. You're tossing that coin every time it isn't the way you want. You're never _actively rigging_ the game in any way, so the game doesn't become sour candy. You're just giving yourself another fair shot.

Despite how 'casual' people seemed to think battle royale games were at the beginning, the hallmarks of this idea have been built into some of the most competitively lauded games like _Super Meat Boy_, where levels are positively _gruelling_, but also extremely short, and give you infinite retries to do over.

Then, Fortnite comes out. And look -- I've never been super into fortnite, but you have to respect how much kids love it. I've never forgotten that one article that said 'kids talk about Fortnite like it's a place. To them, it's just another place _to hang out_'. Anyone who 'was a gamer' before Fortnite should understand this.

Games were always fun, sure, but the real reason you'd log onto _Halo_, or CS was because _hanging out_ in those games was fun. Players who get all snobbish about Fortnite forget about how much of a blast they had in those Team Fortress 2 Minecraft map mods, or on silly or friendly servers, or trading items, or just [surf][surf map]ing with friends and hanging out. The video game is the supreme ice breaker, and the activity all in one.

It feels weird weird to be retrospective on this, and think how when I played games, they were disconnected, for the most part individual experiences. Not just from the perspective of the gameplay, but also the penetration of video game media into society. Some of my fondest memories are of hanging out with friends in games, and I'm honestly really happy that in this society now, any of our kids can, for free spend time with their friends online and wherever they are. And that's _cool_.

I don't think society will really change at all because of it, for the same underlying reason that I think it'll realise that games are about creating stories, spending time and having _fun_. It's been that way since someone left their cave, kicked a pebble into stonehenge and asked their friends to join in.
