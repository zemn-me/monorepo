# If CORS is just a header, why don’t attackers just ignore it?

Here’s a question from a co-worker I get quite often:

> Considering that curl requests do not have the restriction of the fetch API,
> how does this browser policy \[CORS] prevent circumventing abuse or misuse of
> server endpoints if an attacker can anyways do so by default via curl?
> And since a bad actor can use curl what’s the real world effectiveness
> of the browser policy in the first place?

While ‘Cross Origin Resource Sharing’ is a very important security tool for the
modern web, it solves a problem that’s very specific to the security
architecture of the web which leads to many misconceptions.

This question comes down to the crux of why CORS exists. It is often
misconstrued that CORS is a way of _preventing_ different websites from
receiving information from each other, but it’s quite the opposite. Let’s talk
about a world without CORS first.

In the time before CORS, as some readers might remember it was not possible
(with caveats) for _Javascript_ to retrieve data such as JSON from another web
origin in the browser. This restriction is called the ‘same origin policy’
component of the ‘web origin concept’, and underpins much of the security of web
browsing.

If I create a website, mywebsite.com, it can use Javascript to request
information from _only_ mywebsite.com. If this were not the case, I’d simply ask
Javascript to retrieve google.com/account, read your personal information from
the result and send it back to me. Because Javascript makes the request _as you_
with _your cookie_, from\* your browser\*, it gets access to whatever you do, but
is in control of the website author. Note that this restriction _only_ applies
to requests by Javascript. I can embed images and scripts from other sites all I
want.

As a result, before CORS, if I wanted to write a website that retrieved data
from another, such as a Google API I had to do it via my own backend server.
Take a look at this flow:

Here, my webpage
[http://mywebsite.com/index.html](http://mywebsite.com/index.html) requests two
things: (1) my account info from mywebsite.com/me.json and (2) the latitude and
longitude of London via api.google.com/lookup. However, Same Origin Policy
prevents us from requesting Google directly, so we configure our server to make
the request for us.

CORS introduced a suite of headers that start with Acess-Control- that allow the
server to state that it’s safe to allow Javascript to retrieve information. For
example, Access-Control-Allow-Origin: mywebsite.com allows Javascript on
mywebsite.com to access the response of this request.

So why don’t attackers ignore the Access-Control-Allow-Origin header? Because it
doesn’t get them anything. If I’m forming an HTTP request with CuRL, all the
information I’m sending to the server is already known to me, and everything I’m
accessing I already had access to. What the attacker really wants is for the
victim’s browser to relinquish some of the information it has about the victim.

Partially for legacy reasons, requests in browsers have certain ambient
privileges (“ambient authority”). My website in the browser will be sending the
request from the user’s IP address, potentially with the user’s own login
session. CORS navigates allowing access to certain resources that have stated
that they’re aware of what this might entail via Access-Control-Allow-Origin and
preventing old applications using legacy behavior becoming insecure.

## Why don’t we just let anything request anything else and block cookies?

![picture: no gods, no masters (from 'fallout: new vegas')](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2560/1*ahbo8nFu5MSqTyfQttnEug.png)

This may sound to an extent like anarchy, but can’t we just block cookies for
CORS requests and let anyone load anyone else? At that point, I’m not going to
be able to get information about someone’s logged in account, right?

This is not at all a bad idea. In fact, it’s actually part of CORS.
`Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *` does exactly this: it allows any website to load
your resource, but prevents cookies from being sent. It still has to be opted
into, however. The world of `Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *` is arguably
significantly more secure, because it eliminates the entire category of CSRF
vulnerabilities nearly entirely.

But it’s still opt-in because there are, unfortunately plenty of systems that
use something other than cookies for authentication. For example, many printers
and home routers do not bother with cookie based sessions, because it is assumed
that if you can make a connection to the service you are already in the network.
The same goes for many web servers that software starts on your computer.

This is an incorrect assumption because of CSRF — it’s still possible to tell
the browser to load the resource via an HTML tag like `<img src=your.router/logout/>`
and it’ll still execute and log the current user out
but there’s no way to retrieve a response. If one could retrieve a response,
it’d be significantly worse.

CORS also provides functionality to the browser Javascript to set headers on
requests via Access-Control-Allow-Headers in a similar vein: there are many
headers that Javascript can’t control that are important to web security —
Origin probably being the most dangerous but there’s also Cookie , Host and all
sorts.

I hope this article helps shed some light on why CORS exists and how it fits
into browser security. The security benefits of CORS are not inherent to the
CORS protocol itself — after all, as noted you can avoid it completely — but the
alternatives it avoids.

A final point I’d like to make is that CORS is often thought of as a complex
protocol requiring a backend, and this makes it a huge pain for a lot of people
serving certian kinds of assets. Many implementations of CORS use the requesting
Origin header to determine if the request should be allowed, and return that
same origin if it is.

For the most part, CORS is completely static, and one can just send
`Access-Control-Allow-Origin: myorigin` or `Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *` in
response to any request. In earlier drafts of Access-Control-Allow-Origin, this
was more apparent as the header could include multiple origins at once, and
Access-Control-Max-Age facilitates caching of a static CORS policy for a time.

I don’t quite know why `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` now doesn’t allow a list of
whitelisted origins. For a time, Firefox allowed this pattern. My guess is that
early implementations of CORS allowed only one origin and that pattern stuck.
Content Security Policy headers use this pattern for its killer feature
allow-src and its successor to `X-Frame-Options`, the `frame-ancestors` directive
amongst others.
